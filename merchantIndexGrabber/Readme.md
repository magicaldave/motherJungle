# Usage: #

  * Place merchantIndexGrabber into your Data Files folder.

  * Open a command line window inside `Data Files`

  * Run it like so: `merchantIndexGrabber Tribunal.esm`

    merchantIndexGrabber will dump the contents of every merchant NPC's inventory to a file by the same name as the plugin, with .txt at the end. For Tribunal.esm, it would be Tribunal.esm.txt.

    The output should be in a format compatible with SkoomaBreath's customMerchantRestock, which you can find here.

  * Copy the desired npcs directly into the itemsToRestock table, starting at line 45.

  * ???

  * Profit!
